# Forge-post-1.18.2-crashes-on-startup
Minecraft Forge (versions after 1.18.2) will always crash upon  startup with Exit Code 1.  I have tried various methods of correcting this problem but to no avail.  Please read the README file before offering possible solutions.

README:
the solutions I have tried are as follows:
- I have uninstalled and reinstalled the Minecraft Launcher
- I have unsinstalled and reinstalled forge for versions 1.19.2, 1.19.4 and 1.20.1 multiple times. (They are the 'reccomended' download on the Forge website)
- I have emptied my mods folder to prove that Forge is the source of the problem.
- I have read through countless latest.logs in search of an error message but Forge seems to crash before it could generate one.
- I have updated Java because when I find the 'check for java updates' on my computer it says I'm on the most updated version.
- I have set my regional format to English (UK) on Windows and the Minecraft Launcher. (Several pople on Reddit claimed it fixed the problem)

  I have attached my latest.log and debug.log for version 1.20.1 and I will be grateful for any help.  I will also provide screenshots.
